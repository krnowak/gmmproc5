alpha - simple mm module sources can be generated (without documentation)
and compiled without warnings with g++ using -Wall -Wextra -pedantic flags
that means:
  - write a defs parser - DONE
  - write a template files (hg, ccg) tokenizer - DONE
  - write a plugin system for template commands
  - write plugins for basic template commands
  - write conversions parsers
  - write an application which takes the same parameters as old gmmproc4

beta - documentation can be generated also and some more sophisticated mm module
sources can be generated and compiled without warnings with g++ using -Wall
-Wextra -pedantic flags
that means:
  - write a documentation parser (in truth - xml parser)
  - decide whether gmmproc can be dependent on external libraries or stay
    on using standard library only.
  - write a mappings parser
  - add new functionality to application
  - write plugins for more sophisticated template commands

gamma - documentation and batch processing and gtkmm sources can be generated
and compiled without warnings with g++ using -Wall -Wextra -pedantic flags
that means:
  - document all code, if it is not documented yet.
  - write a configuration parser (something a'la doxygen)
  - write plugins for all used template commands
  - also write plugins with new template commands, so they can maybe deprecate
    and replace some already existing

first release - usable for all mm-modules
that means:
  - integration with mm-common
  - bugfixing
  - bugfixing
  - one more time: bugfixing

second release - use gir definitions as API reference
that means:
  - write gir files parser - previously written xml parser can be used
  - bugfixing x3
